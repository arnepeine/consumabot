# Consumabot - Image recogintion with Tensorflow for medical consumables

Millions of medical consumables (like syringes, sterile swabs, one-way material, fluid supplements) are used in hospitals every day. Although these materials are suprisingly expensive, it is amost impossible to keep track of them. Most of them do not have a barcode or RFID on them, even if they have, using a barcode scanner in the medical environment is certainly not an ideal solution.

Consumabot is a low-cost solution for this problem, using common computing platforms and open-source software/hardware. It runs on Raspberry Pi, equipped with a standard camera and a 32 GB SD memory card. It recognizes the acquired image via a Neural Network, implemented on TensorFlow.

Use Consumabot for the following purposes:
- Keep track of consumables or other materials (e.g. recognize how much material you need for which patient)
- Get exact timings for the use of medical material within patients (no more documentation delay, extremely useful for retrospective analysis of vitals)
- Quality assurance and training

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!

# Step 1: The hardware setup
Get the required hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen 
- Raspberry Pi Official 8MP camera
- Flatband camera connector cable
- Display Case - Black
- 32GB SD card

# Step 2: Install Raspbian
You can install Raspbian by copying the official image of Raspbian (http://raspberrypi.org)
- Download Etcher (https://etcher.io/) and install it.
- Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside.
- Open Etcher and select the Raspberry Pi .img or .zip file you wish to write.
- Review your selections and click 'Flash!'

# Step 3: Install requirements
Raspbian comes with a preinstalled Python 3.4, so there is no need to install that. If you are using an alternative distribution, you might need to do that.

Now install pip

```sh
$ pip3 -V # for Python 3.n
$ pip -V  # for Python 2.7
```

Atlas is a math library and also required for Tensorflow

```sh
$ sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
```

Installing tensorflow is now much easier, because it comes precompiled for Raspberry Pi!

```sh
$ pip3 install tensorflow     # Python 3.n
$ pip install tensorflow # Python 2.7
```

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
